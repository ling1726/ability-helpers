# Tabster examples

This is a storybook project that contains examples of scenarios that the `tabster` library can support. Also serves as a development workbench.

Currently all examples are in react, following the older `demo` package, but in the future standard HTML and vanilla js examples are envisioned.

### Usage

`yarn start` will run the storybook

`yarn start:production` will use the built version of `tabster` in the repo

`yarn build` will build the storybook as a static website
